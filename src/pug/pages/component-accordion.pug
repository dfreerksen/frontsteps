      p Build vertically collapsing accordions in combination with our Collapse JavaScript plugin.

      h4 How it works
      p The accordion uses <code>collapse</code> internally to make it collapsible. To render an accordion that's expanded, add the <code>.open</code> class on the <code>.accordion</code>.

      h4 Example
      p Click the accordions below to expand/collapse the accordion content.
